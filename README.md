# 🏛️ SomaGov – Citizen Engagement System

**SomaGov** is a digital platform designed to modernize how **Rwandan citizens** engage with public services. Currently, complaints are often handled through fragmented channels — leading to slow responses and low citizen satisfaction.

This platform aims to centralize and streamline communication between the public and government agencies.
